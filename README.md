# Togethr 
Togethr is a Tinder-like social app designed to connect individuals with similar interests beyond the internet. Together wants you to get out there, and well, _get together!_ Want to try a new restaraunt but have no one to go with? Or maybe there is a car meet in your town and you're looking for a group to go with. Either way, whatever the activity may be, post it on Togethr with the location, date, time, and number of guests, then just sit back, relax, and let Togethr connect you with like-minided individuals. Togethr makes the process of making connections simple and serves as a great way to build lasting relationships with people of similar interests.

**Technical Notes: </br>**
 Users are first prompted to login or register. To register an account the user needs a valid email to which email confirmation is sent. Within the app, users can perform [CRUD operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). That is, users can create, edit, delete, like and view events, RSVP or cancel RSVPs, and edit their own user details (change user, pass, etc). 

This app features the popular card swiping mechanism found in many dating apps combined with beautiful and simple black, white, and purple UI making the user experience quite comfortable.
